## Crack-Arbitrary-Oriented-Object-Detection-Dataset

### 1.description

In order to promote the research of pavement crack detection based on arbitrary-oriented object detection, we used the inspection vehicle to collect a large amount of data on the road. The image contains many difficult samples ( including brake marks, water, shadow, repair, etc. ). Features of the dataset include:

(1) Data collection Qingshuiting avenue and other roads in Nanjing, China</br>
(2) Vehicle speed from 30-40 km / h</br>
(3) The dataset contains a thousand images and corresponding annotation files</br>
(4) The acquisition equipment is a Hikvision 240MV-CE060-10UM industrial camera with a WL1224-4MP 12mm lens and an image resolution of 2560 × 1440</br>
(5) The data format is as follows:</br>
> x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, class, hardsample</br>
